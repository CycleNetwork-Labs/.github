**Cycle network**: Cycle’s mission is to empower the boundless creativity of Web3. By providing a chains network with seamless liquidity and functionality across all chains, and self custody function, aka settlement layer, shared liquidity model, and AA model, Cycle aims to liberate developers from repetitive tasks, from different layer structures to information/asset synchronization and deployment. Cycle encourages developers to wander uncharted realms, exploring the vast potential of Web3 without the burden of reinventing the wheel at every turn.Imagine a Web3 world that resembles the enchanting realms of Zelda. In this world, developers are like players who possess features like Ultrahand, Fuse, and Skyview Tower Open. Developers can easily create decentralized applications (dApps) through a simplified process. By using simple actions, developers can seamlessly assemble functionalities across the expanse of Web3. Cycle frees users from mastering each blockchain’s intricacies, making it easier to weave their creativity.  

Cycle Network addresses these challenges by offering secure chain abstraction technology. This enables developers to freely program for the entire Web3 user base and data using SDKs and other middleware, achieving true chain abstraction. Cycle Network constructs chain abstraction infrastructure through verifiable state aggregation and combines the Omni State Channel Indexer (OSCI) with a decentralized aggregated Sequencer to realize global state proof of trustless state changes across blockchain networks. It extracts the inherent trustless cross-chain characteristics from Rollup and extends them through the Rollup's Data Availability (DA) layer to a decentralized omni-chain settlement layer. This structure allows Cycle Network to support trustless global state proof across all Layer 1, Layer 2, and application chains. Cycle Network also inherits security from the chosen Rollup's security layer to achieve trustless global state proof. The Omni ZK-Rollup enables verifiers to efficiently confirm the existence of state changes between related chains and the Cycle Network. CycleNetwork further leverages ZK hardware acceleration to continuously optimize latency and enhance the user experience.
